This game has been made by me on the ludum dare 41.
under the theme Combine Two incompatible generes.

I combined a game that we used to play with my brother, and a multimedia story telling.

The first one is as simple as counting christmas trees.
When Christmas came to town, it was a fun game to count how many christmas trees you see while walking around the streets, or going somewhere.

The second one, is a story that will be explained step by step. 

Combining both, The idea is to go walk around, looking fro christmas trees, and once you find one, tell the game, to continue with the story.

Hope you like it : )

I've made he story, the art and the coding (using c++ and SFML)
the music is the Vision Fugitives Op.22 of Prokofiev, by Boris Berman.
